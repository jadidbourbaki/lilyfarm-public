The Lily Farm API currently has two API calls. No API Key or credentials are required. However, please keep request traffic manageable, our infrastructure is very modest currently.

#### Data Sources

The Lily Farm API supports multiple data sources. There are two data sources currently supported:

- `usda` (data fetched from the United States Department of Agriculture)
- `newyork` (data fetched from the New York State government)

#### API Reference

##### HTTP GET nearestNJson

Get the nearest `N` Farmers' Markets from a given `latitude` and `longitude`. Only accepts 
`GET` requests. 

###### Example:

The following returns the nearest 10 Farmers' Markets from Location `(LAT, LON)`.

```
lilyfarm.org/nearestNJson?n=10&latitude=LAT&longitude=LON&datasource=usda
```


##### HTTP GET nearestNJsonByZipCode

Get the nearest `N` Farmers' Markets from a given `zipCode`. Only accepts `GET` requests.

###### Example:

The following returns the nearest 10 Farmers' Markets from Zip code `ZIP`

```

##### Serialization

For both the above API calls, Lily Farm returns an array of JSON records of type FarmersMarketRecord.

```go
